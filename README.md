# Git Watcher

Git Watcher allows you to constantly see an up-to-date git graph or status while
using the terminal. Git Watcher automatically refreshes when it notices a change
in the state of your repository. Now, you don't have to constantly run `git status`
and `git log --graph` to the see the state of your repository!
